# Anvil-PID-Tuner
A simple TVC Model Rocket simulator that allows the user to manually tune his PID controller

This software is not designed to give you 100% accurate PID values, it is only designed to give ballpark values.
Use at your own risk

Some information about the sliders:
Kp, Kd, and Inertia are all multiplied by 100, ie: if the slider says Kp = 115, Kp is actually 1.15

When you download the exe, Windows will do everything in its power to make sure that you don't open it.
I promise that there are no malicious things included with the exe file.

The Version number is determined by the size of the update. If the update is only minor, the version goes up by 0.01, 
if the update adds a lot, or fixes major bugs, the version goes up by 0.1
